# 8020 Resources
The classifier RESOURCES is applied to contexts to identify other contexts whose entities can be referenced. For example, most contexts will import ROOT+context.SYS.

The entities of a context can only reference entities in the same context or resource contexts. A context then only depends on its self and its resources.

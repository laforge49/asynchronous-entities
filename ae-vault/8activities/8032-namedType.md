# 8032 Named (Value) Type
Adding named (value) type to the form of a name: contextRoot+type_structureType-root^keyType&namedType$dataType.

A named type can only be present when no data type is present. Like data (value) type, a named type applies to the value when the name with the named type is used as a key. Again, like data type, the named type is used to validate the scalar, vector values or map values associated with the key containing the named type.

When a named type has a value of ?, then the value is an unconstrained name.

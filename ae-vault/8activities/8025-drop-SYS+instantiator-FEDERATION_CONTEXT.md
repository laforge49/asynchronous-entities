# 8025 drop SYS+instantiator-FEDERATION_CONTEXT
Created [2140.3 Thursday (week 40), 10-7-2021](../6blog/21/21-3%20Q3/2140/2140.3%20Thursday%20(week%2040),%2010-7-2021.md)

The FEDERATION_CONTEXT entity is an occult programming artifact used by a federator to accquire and release entities. This functionality needs to be moved directly to the federator. There is no need to have a federation context.

# 8039 Async Processing

A descriptor-ASYNC$bool attriute, when true, indicates that the gem has a port and can be invoked asynchronously.

Update [2202.6 Saturday (week 02), 01-15-2022](../6blog/22/22-1%20Q1/2202/2202.6%20Saturday%20(week%2002),%2001-15-2022.md):
The invariant flag can be used in place of async, with only non-invariant gems supporting asynchronous processing.

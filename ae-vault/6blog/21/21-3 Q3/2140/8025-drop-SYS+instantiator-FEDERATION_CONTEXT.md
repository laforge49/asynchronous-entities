Created [2140.4 Thursday (week 40), 10-7-2021](2140.4%20Thursday%20(week%2040),%2010-7-2021.md)

The FEDERATION_CONTEXT entity is an occult programming artifact used by a federator to accquire and release entities. This functionality needs to be moved directly to the federator. There is no need to have a federation context.

# 8006 Report as Markdown
Converting the generated reports from plain text to markdown files could be quite interesting.

Descriptors no longer display the default context name.

Revised: [2146.1 Monday (week 46), 11-15-2021](2146.1%20Monday%20(week%2046),%2011-15-2021.md)

The md reports should just have the full yamal of the entity, as well as the mark down content, adding considerable transparency over the current implementation.

Completed [2146.2 Tuesday (week 46), 11-16-2021](2146.2%20Tuesday%20(week%2046),%2011-16-2021.md)

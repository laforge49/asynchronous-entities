# 8004 Validation
We need to be able to validate the content of an entity. Likely this will require additional metadata.

Our first step will be to delay name validation until after the gems in a context have been created. All gem names then should have an existing gem. Updated [2148.1 Monday (week 48). 11-29-2021](../2148/2148.1%20Monday%20(week%2048).%2011-29-2021.md)

completed [2152.2 Tuesday (week 52), 12-28-2021](2152.2%20Tuesday%20(week%2052),%2012-28-2021.md) (see [8038-confirm entity existence](8038-confirm%20entity%20existence.md))

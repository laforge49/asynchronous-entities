Gem names, when they include a context prefix, are unique and used to access the facets of a gem in the gem-maps-atom.

Gem names are used both as keys and values in various structures.

Gem names have several distinct parts which occur in a fixed order:

- [11151-context-prefix](11151-context-prefix.md)
- [11152-gem-type](11152-gem-type.md)
- [11153-structure-type](11153-structure-type.md)
- [11154-base-name](11154-base-name.md)
- [11155-keyword-type](11155-keyword-type.md)
- 11156-value-type

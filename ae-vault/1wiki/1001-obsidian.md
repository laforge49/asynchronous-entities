 # 1001 Obsidian
 Obsidian is a knowledge management tool that is great for creating and browsing .md files, and a whole lot more as well with all the plugins that are available for it. 
 
 Obsidian is free to [download](https://obsidian.md/) is easy to learn and had cool features like backlink searches. But if you want, you can just navigate the .md files with the tool of your choice, though there are some extensions to the markdown that have been added by Obsidian.
 
 When using Obsidian, just point it to the asynchronous-entities/ae-vault folder.

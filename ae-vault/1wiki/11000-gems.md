- [12100-asynchronousMode](12100-asynchronousMode.md)
- [12200-synchronousMode](12200-synchronousMode.md)
    - [11131-INVARIANT](11131-INVARIANT.md)
- [1115-facet-NAME&%](1115-facet-NAME&%.md)

The data held by a gem is divided into [11100-FACETS](11100-FACETS.md)

Every gem has a [1115-facet-NAME&%](1115-facet-NAME&%.md), a context, a tree of attributes and an optional dedicated port for receiving messages. The state map includes classifiers and descriptors, name/value pairs used for navigation and to control an entity's behavior. Entities would have two modes of operation: [12100-asynchronousMode](12100-asynchronousMode.md) and [12200-synchronousMode](12200-synchronousMode.md).

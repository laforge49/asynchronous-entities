# 10030 YAML

If you are unfamiliar with [YAML](https://yaml.org/), you can think of it as an alternative to JSON, EDN or XML. It is a bit richer than JSON, easier to maintain than EDN and less verbose than XML.

The primary use of YAML here is as a scripting language, allowing you to direct requests to various [Gems](11000-gems.md). 

A secondary use is in the serialization of Gems as .md files. The front matter in those .md files is YAML and the result is compatible with Obsidian, all be it Obsidian plugins generally speak only a greatly simplified form of YAML.

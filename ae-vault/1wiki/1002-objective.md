# 1002 Objective
For the past few years I've worked on a single-threaded program with all state collected in a tree built using persistent maps with something under a million name/value pairs. It feels wrong, especially if I want to support swing or multi-threading in general. What I'd like to do is to create a structure built from [1003-gems](1003-gems.md) which support both synchronous and asynchronous behavior.

Gem names, when they include a context prefix, are unique and used to access the facets of a gem in the gem-maps-atom.

Gem names are used both as keys and values in various structures. When used in a key, a gem name may be prefaced by an [11157-order-value](11157-order-value.md).

Gem names have several distinct parts which occur in a fixed series. These parts are delineated with the characters +, \_, -, ^, @, & and $.

A gem name has up to 6 parts:

- [11151-context-prefix](11151-context-prefix.md)
- [11152-gem-type](11152-gem-type.md)
- [11153-structure-type](11153-structure-type.md)
- [11154-base-name](11154-base-name.md)
- [11155-key-type](11155-key-type.md)
- [11156-value-type](11156-value-type.md)

# 11157 Order Value

When a gem name is used in a map key, it may be prefaced by an order value which determines the order of the gems in the map. An order value may only be present when the key is a string.

The order values used with gem names need not be consistent across maps. The order value is not part of the gem name but rather is part of the container where the gem names are used in the keys.

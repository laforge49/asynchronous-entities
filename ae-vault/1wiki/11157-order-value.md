# 11157 Order Value

When a gem name is used in a map key, it may be prefaced by an order value which determines the order of the gems in the map. Order values may be a string, an integer, or not present. Within a given map, all order values will be strings, integers or not present. The order value is delineated from the gem name by a space.

The order values assigned to gems need not be consistent across maps. The order value is not part of the gem name but rather is part of the container holding the gems.
